# Enterprise Payment Reconciliation & Fraud Monitoring System

An industry-style Java full stack microservices project for processing payment transactions, detecting suspicious activity, reconciling bank or gateway settlement files, and giving finance/admin teams a dashboard for monitoring, reports, alerts, notifications, and audit visibility.

This project is designed to represent the kind of real-world work expected from a Java Full Stack Developer with around 3.6 years of experience: Spring Boot microservices, secure APIs, Kafka-based asynchronous processing, relational and document databases, React dashboard, Dockerized local deployment, and CI/CD readiness.

## Business Problem



Payment teams need to process large numbers of customer transactions while continuously answering three operational questions:

- Was the payment successful and traceable?
- Does the internal transaction match the bank or gateway settlement file?
- Is the transaction pattern suspicious enough to require review?

In many enterprise systems these workflows are spread across manual spreadsheets, delayed fraud checks, disconnected settlement reports, and limited audit trails. This increases operational risk, slows reconciliation, and makes fraud monitoring reactive instead of proactive.

## Solution

The platform provides a centralized payment operations system with:

- Secure user authentication and role-based access.
- Transaction creation, search, status lifecycle, and audit logging.
- Kafka event publishing for transaction and reconciliation events.
- Rule-based fraud detection using asynchronous Kafka consumers.
- CSV/XLSX settlement file upload and reconciliation result generation.
- Notification logging for payment, fraud, and reconciliation events.
- Dashboard APIs and React visualizations for operational reporting.
- Docker Compose setup for local full-stack execution.

## Security Flow

1. User logs in through `auth-service`.
2. Password is verified using BCrypt.
3. `auth-service` generates a signed JWT containing user identity and roles.
4. React stores the JWT and sends it in the `Authorization` header.
5. API Gateway validates the JWT signature and expiry.
6. API Gateway enforces role-based authorization by route group.
7. API Gateway forwards authenticated identity headers to downstream services:
   - `X-Authenticated-User`
   - `X-User-Id`
   - `X-User-Roles`

Public APIs:

- `/api/auth/login`
- `/api/auth/register`
- `/swagger-ui/**`
- `/v3/api-docs/**`
- `/actuator/**`

```text
payment_auth_db
payment_transaction_db
payment_reconciliation_db
payment_notification_db

## Interview Explanation

This project can be explained as an enterprise payment operations platform built with Java 17, Spring Boot 3, Spring Cloud microservices, Kafka, MySQL, MongoDB, and React.

The main workflow starts when a finance user creates a payment transaction. The transaction service stores the transaction in MySQL and publishes a Kafka event. Fraud detection consumes the event asynchronously, applies rule-based checks, stores alerts in MongoDB, and publishes fraud alert events. Reconciliation service allows finance users to upload bank or gateway settlement files, parses CSV/XLSX data, identifies matched, mismatched, missing, and duplicate records, stores summaries, and publishes completion events. Notification service consumes important events and stores mock notification logs.

Security is handled centrally at the API Gateway. Auth service validates credentials and issues JWT tokens. The gateway validates every protected request and enforces role-based access for admin, finance, and auditor users.

Microservices were used because each domain has a different scaling and ownership pattern. Transaction processing, fraud checks, reconciliation file processing, reporting, and notifications can evolve independently. Kafka decouples real-time workflows and prevents one service from blocking another.

## Future Enhancements

- Add Testcontainers for MySQL, MongoDB, and Kafka integration tests.
- Add Kafka retry topics and dead-letter topics.
- Add Schema Registry for event contract compatibility.
- Replace mock notifications with real email/SMS provider integration.
- Implement live reporting aggregation from service databases or event streams.
- Add Redis caching for dashboard summaries.
- Add OpenTelemetry distributed tracing.
- Add centralized logging with ELK or Loki.
- Add Terraform for AWS ECS/EKS deployment.
- Move secrets to AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault.
- Add refresh-token flow and token revocation.
- Add reconciliation matching against live internal transaction APIs.
